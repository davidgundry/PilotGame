# PilotGame

PilotGame is a speech-powered plane-flying game. It was developed during my PhD into applied games for collecting spoken lingustic data.

The game is incorporated within an experiment allows the player to play for 5 mintues before delivering a questionnaire. TelemetryTools is used to handle uploading the data to a server.
